Stacks and Queues
The assignment requires us to implement 
1. Stacks using Doubly Linked List  
2. Queues using Arrays
3. Queues using Singly Linked List
4. Circular Queues using arrays. Here the array is not of fixed max size. It should be able to grow.
Also find their time complexity O(n)

The following files have the implementaions.
1. stacks/dll/DoublyLinkedListStack.java
2. queues/ArrayQueue.java 
3. queues/SLListQueue.java
4. queues/CircularQueue.java
